00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.300
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.640
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US 
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.850
SO MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE 
WILL BE BASKING IN SOME 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.850
NOVEMBER SUNSHINE AND IN 
THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE BIT 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.500
COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE 
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.300
SHOULD BE.
