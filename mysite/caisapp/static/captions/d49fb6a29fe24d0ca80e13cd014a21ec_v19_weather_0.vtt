00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:08.868
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 

00:00:08.868 --> 00:00:09.568
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:11.344
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.726
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING SO 

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:14.305
MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE WILL BE

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:15.292
BASKING IN SOME NOVEMBER SUNSHINE

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:16.673
AND IN THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE

00:00:16.673 --> 00:00:18.055
BIT COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE

00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:19.239
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
