00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:11.355
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:12.055
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:13.797
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:15.152
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING SO 

00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:16.700
MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE WILL BE

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.668
BASKING IN SOME NOVEMBER SUNSHINE

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:19.023
AND IN THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE

00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:20.378
BIT COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:21.539
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
