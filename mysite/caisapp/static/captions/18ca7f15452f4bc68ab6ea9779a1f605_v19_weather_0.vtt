00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:08.411
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 

00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:09.111
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:09.865
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:10.452
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING SO 

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:11.122
MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE WILL BE

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:11.541
BASKING IN SOME NOVEMBER SUNSHINE

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:12.128
AND IN THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:12.714
BIT COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:13.217
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
