00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.339
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.039
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.505
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:20.423
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING SO 

00:00:20.423 --> 00:00:22.614
MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE WILL BE

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:23.984
BASKING IN SOME NOVEMBER SUNSHINE

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:25.902
AND IN THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:27.820
BIT COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.464
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
