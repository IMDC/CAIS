WEBVTT

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.240
WE'VE GOT WIND GUSTS RIGHT NOW 
VERY NEAR TO 40 KM/H A LITTLE 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.680
BIT STRONGER DOWN AT THE ISLAND 
BECAUSE THE WIND IS PUSHING OUT 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.360
OVER THE LAKE. LESS FRICTION SO 
IT TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.200
STRONGER. AS WE GO THROUGH THE 
DAY TOMORROW,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.680
I MEANT TO PUT A PAUSE IN THERE 
SLOW THAT DOWN FOR YOU BUT WE 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.040
ARE LOOKING AT GUSTY CONDITIONS 
TONIGHT STARTING TO EASE 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.820
THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW SO WE 
DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A WINDCHILL 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.320
TO DEAL WITH.
