00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.300
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.980
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US NOW

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.800
AND VERY SLOW MOVING OF TODAY 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.850
BASKING IN NOVEMBER SUNSHINE AND

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.850
WELL ABOVE THE SEASONAL AVERAGE

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.300
WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
