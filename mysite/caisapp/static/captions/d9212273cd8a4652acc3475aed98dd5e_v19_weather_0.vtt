00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:13.182
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 

00:00:13.182 --> 00:00:13.882
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:15.159
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.152
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING SO 

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:17.286
MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE WILL BE

00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:17.995
BASKING IN SOME NOVEMBER SUNSHINE

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:18.988
AND IN THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE

00:00:18.988 --> 00:00:19.981
BIT COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:20.832
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
