00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.680
WE'VE GOT WIND GUSTS RIGHT NOW

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.240
VERY NEAR TO 40 KM/H A LITTLE BIT

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.120
STRONGER DOWN AT THE ISLAND

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.680
BECAUSE THE WIND IS PUSHING OUT

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.360
OVER THE LAKE.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.360
LESS FRICTION SO IT TENDS TO BE A

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.800
LITTLE BIT STRONGER.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.200

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.560
I MEANT TO PUT A PAUSE IN THERE

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.680
SLOW THAT DOWN FOR YOU BUT WE 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680
ARE LOOKING AT GUSTY CONDITIONS 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.040
