WEBVTT

00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:05.743
WE'VE GOT WIND GUSTS RIGHT NOW

00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:08.303
VERY NEAR TO 40 KM/H A LITTLE BIT

00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:09.183
STRONGER DOWN AT THE ISLAND

00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:10.743
BECAUSE THE WIND IS PUSHING OUT

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:11.423
OVER THE LAKE.

00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:12.423
LESS FRICTION SO IT TENDS TO BE A

00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:13.863
LITTLE BIT STRONGER.

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:14.605
AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW,

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:15.453
I MEANT TO PUT A PAUSE IN THERE

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:16.195
SLOW THAT DOWN FOR YOU BUT WE 

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:16.725
ARE LOOKING AT GUSTY CONDITIONS 

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:17.255
TONIGHT STARTING TO EASE THROUGH

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:17.997
THE DAY TOMORROW SO WE DON'T HAVE 

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:18.739
MUCH OF A WINDCHILL TO DEAL WITH.
