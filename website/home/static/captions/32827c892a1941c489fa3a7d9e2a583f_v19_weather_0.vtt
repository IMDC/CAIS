00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.399
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:06.099
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.242
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.909
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING SO 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.813
MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE WILL BE

00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:13.004
BASKING IN SOME NOVEMBER SUNSHINE

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:14.670
AND IN THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.337
BIT COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE

00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:17.766
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
