00:00:03.272 --> 00:00:04.872
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:05.572
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:06.222
AS WE SEE IS

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:06.727
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING SO 

00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:07.305
MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE WILL BE

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:07.666
BASKING IN SOME NOVEMBER SUNSHINE

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.171
AND IN THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE

00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:08.677
BIT COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:09.110
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
