WEBVTT

00:00:05.496 --> 00:00:07.146
WE'VE GOT WIND GUSTS RIGHT NOW

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:09.706
VERY NEAR TO 40 KM/H A LITTLE BIT

00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:10.586
STRONGER DOWN AT THE ISLAND

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:12.146
BECAUSE THE WIND IS PUSHING OUT

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:12.826
OVER THE LAKE.

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:13.826
LESS FRICTION SO IT TENDS TO BE A

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:15.266
LITTLE BIT STRONGER.

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:15.806
AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW,

00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:16.423
I MEANT TO PUT A PAUSE IN THERE

00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:16.963
SLOW THAT DOWN FOR YOU BUT WE 

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:17.348
ARE LOOKING AT GUSTY CONDITIONS 

00:00:17.348 --> 00:00:17.734
TONIGHT STARTING TO EASE THROUGH

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:18.274
THE DAY TOMORROW SO WE DON'T HAVE 

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:18.814
MUCH OF A WINDCHILL TO DEAL WITH.
