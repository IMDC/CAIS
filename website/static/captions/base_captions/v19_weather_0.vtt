00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.600
WE DO HAVE THE RISK FOR SOME 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.300
ACTIVE WEATHER. 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.980
AS WE CAN SEE IT IS NORTH OF US

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.640
NOW BUT IT'S VERY SLOW MOVING SO 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.800
MOST OF THE DAY TODAY WE WILL BE

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.850
BASKING IN SOME NOVEMBER SUNSHINE

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.850
AND IN THROUGH THE EAST A LITTLE

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.850
BIT COOLER BUT STILL WELL ABOVE THE

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.300
SEASONAL AVERAGE WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
