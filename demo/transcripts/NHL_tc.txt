00:00:01:07	00:00:02:07	00:00:01:00	>> Third period about
00:00:02:07	00:00:04:02	00:00:01:25	to get underway here at the
00:00:04:02	00:00:06:26	00:00:02:24	MTS Centre in a 2-1 game for
00:00:06:26	00:00:08:11	00:00:01:15	the Anaheim Ducks.
00:00:08:11	00:00:09:17	00:00:01:06	No scoring in period
00:00:09:17	00:00:10:13	00:00:00:26	number two.
00:00:10:13	00:00:11:20	00:00:01:07	Andrew Copp finds a lane and
00:00:11:20	00:00:14:18	00:00:02:28	blows one by Jonathan Bernier.
00:00:14:18	00:00:16:21	00:00:02:03	Jets have the 1-0 lead.
00:00:16:21	00:00:19:04	00:00:02:13	Pavlec the save off of Fowler.
00:00:19:04	00:00:20:18	00:00:01:14	Logan shot, bats in the rebound.
00:00:20:18	00:00:22:22	00:00:02:04	That was a shorthanded tally and
00:00:22:22	00:00:25:04	00:00:02:12	then Getzlaf leads the attack.
00:00:25:04	00:00:27:00	00:00:01:26	It ends up on the stick of
00:00:27:00	00:00:28:07	00:00:01:07	Rickard Rakell, who finds some
00:00:28:07	00:00:29:23	00:00:01:16	room on the short side.
00:00:29:23	00:00:31:06	00:00:01:13	And that's the way we stand
00:00:31:06	00:00:33:13	00:00:02:07	going into the third period.
00:00:33:13	00:00:35:04	00:00:01:21	>> And the third
00:00:35:04	00:00:36:07	00:00:01:03	period starts for the Winnipeg
00:00:36:07	00:00:37:14	00:00:01:07	Jets with a power play.
00:00:37:14	00:00:39:09	00:00:01:25	They had a little bit of a
00:00:39:09	00:00:42:05	00:00:02:26	mix-up there at the end of
00:00:42:05	00:00:44:04	00:00:01:29	number two.
00:00:44:04	00:00:46:19	00:00:02:15	Right now they have
00:00:46:19	00:00:48:00	00:00:01:11	Kesler's number on the board as
00:00:48:00	00:00:49:26	00:00:01:26	Kesler, Perry in the box for the
00:00:49:26	00:00:51:10	00:00:01:14	Ducks, and Mark Scheifele for
00:00:51:10	00:00:53:09	00:00:01:29	the Winnipeg Jets.
00:00:53:09	00:00:54:08	00:00:00:29	>> Yeah, probably
00:00:54:08	00:00:55:13	00:00:01:05	Corey Perry's penalty because
00:00:55:13	00:00:57:03	00:00:01:20	they'll saw off Kesler and
00:00:57:03	00:00:59:02	00:00:01:29	Scheifele, the original
00:00:59:02	00:01:01:18	00:00:02:14	combatants. and then, as you
00:01:01:18	00:01:02:29	00:00:01:11	mentioned, it was Corey
00:01:02:29	00:01:04:01	00:00:01:02	Perry that came in and grabbed
00:01:04:01	00:01:06:28	00:00:02:27	Blake Wheeler.
00:01:06:28	00:01:08:22	00:00:01:24	So the Jets do have the power
00:01:08:22	00:01:10:10	00:00:01:18	play, fourth power play of the
00:01:10:10	00:01:12:01	00:00:01:21	night for the Winnipeg Jets,
00:01:12:01	00:01:14:29	00:00:02:28	as they're down by one.
00:01:14:29	00:01:18:14	00:00:03:15	Fowler, and he'll dig it free,
00:01:18:14	00:01:19:18	00:00:01:04	clear it to the line.
00:01:19:18	00:01:21:07	00:00:01:19	Kept in, knocked down by Blake
00:01:21:07	00:01:23:07	00:00:02:00	Wheeler, for Dustin Byfuglien.
00:01:23:07	00:01:25:17	00:00:02:10	Into the slot. Brian Little,
00:01:25:17	00:01:27:03	00:00:01:16	a shot, and Cam Fowler got
00:01:27:03	00:01:28:04	00:00:01:01	in front of that.
00:01:28:04	00:01:29:20	00:00:01:16	>> Ducks so good at
00:01:29:20	00:01:30:29	00:00:01:09	getting sticks in passing and
00:01:30:29	00:01:33:14	00:00:02:15	shooting lanes.
00:01:33:14	00:01:34:22	00:00:01:08	>> Getzlaf couldn't
00:01:34:22	00:01:37:01	00:00:02:09	handle it. on it is Adam Lowry
00:01:37:01	00:01:37:29	00:00:00:28	for Blake Wheeler.
00:01:37:29	00:01:40:08	00:00:02:09	Wheeler put it to the front of
00:01:40:08	00:01:41:03	00:00:00:25	the net.
00:01:41:03	00:01:42:27	00:00:01:24	No one could get a stick on it.
00:01:42:27	00:01:44:25	00:00:01:28	After it is Nick Petan for
00:01:44:25	00:01:47:09	00:00:02:14	Adam Lowry, back for Petan.
00:01:47:09	00:01:49:08	00:00:01:29	The Ducks very aggressive on
00:01:49:08	00:01:51:18	00:00:02:10	the penalty kill.
00:01:51:18	00:01:54:04	00:00:02:16	Wheeler back up top for
00:01:54:04	00:01:55:13	00:00:01:09	Byfuglien.
00:01:55:13	00:01:56:18	00:00:01:05	The wrist shot, Bernier to
00:01:56:18	00:01:59:15	00:00:02:27	save, rebound and cleared away.
00:01:59:15	00:02:01:04	00:00:01:17	Petan back for Byfuglien.
00:02:01:04	00:02:02:01	00:00:00:27	Byfuglien into the slot looking
00:02:02:01	00:02:03:06	00:00:01:05	for Little.
00:02:03:06	00:02:04:25	00:00:01:19	Getzlaf knocked it away.
00:02:04:25	00:02:06:19	00:00:01:24	Petan sends it down low.
00:02:06:19	00:02:08:15	00:00:01:26	Bieksa with Little after him.
00:02:08:15	00:02:10:01	00:00:01:16	Lowry helps out.
00:02:10:01	00:02:12:02	00:00:02:01	Lowry is up with it for Wheeler
00:02:12:02	00:02:14:18	00:00:02:16	in front, trying to go backside.
00:02:14:18	00:02:16:05	00:00:01:17	That got tipped away and it will
00:02:16:05	00:02:19:13	00:00:03:08	slip out to centre ice.
00:02:19:13	00:02:21:03	00:00:01:20	Petan very quickly back in for
00:02:21:03	00:02:21:28	00:00:00:25	Blake Wheeler.
00:02:21:28	00:02:23:19	00:00:01:21	Wheeler takes a bump, leaves it
00:02:23:19	00:02:24:14	00:00:00:25	for Byfuglien.
00:02:24:14	00:02:25:17	00:00:01:03	Around for Andrew Copp.
00:02:25:17	00:02:27:08	00:00:01:21	35 seconds in the power play,
00:02:27:08	00:02:28:08	00:00:01:00	Copp couldn't handle it.
