WEBVTT

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.567
>> Kate: MITCH MARNER PICKED UP

00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:05.100
AN ASSIST ON KADRI'S 20TH. HE IS

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:06.467
NOW THE LEAGUE LEADER AMONG

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.934
ROOKIES WITH 39 POINTS. MARNER

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:10.734
ALSO HAS A TEAM-HIGH 12

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:12.567
MULTI-POINT GAMES THIS SEASON.

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:14.834
TORONTO'S ROOKIES HAVE 175

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:17.534
POINTS SO FAR THIS YEAR,

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:19.367
THAT IS THE MOST IN THE

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:20.734
NHL. WELCOME TO SPORTSCENTRE,

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:22.534
EVERYONE. KATE ALONGSIDE

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.000
NATASHA. SO UNFORTUNATELY FOR

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:25.200
THE FLAMES, I MEAN, THEY LOOKED

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.400
LIKE THEY HAD A LITTLE MOMENTUM

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.400
AS OF LATE, AND NOW THEY JUST

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.601
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE REELING ONCE

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.567
AGAIN. ON THE FLIP SIDE, THOUGH,

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:34.033
TORONTO SNAPPING THEIR MINI

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:35.267
SLIDE, AND GOOD FOR THEM TO PICK

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.501
UP A MONSTER WIN AT HOME BECAUSE

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.567
WE KNOW THEY'RE GREAT ON THE

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:38.634
ROAD BUT THEY HAVE STRUGGLED AT

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.901
TIMES AT THE AIR CANADA CENTRE.

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:40.968
>> YEAH, THEY LOOKED REALLY GOOD

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.067
ON MONDAY. AND LIKE YOU

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:43.133
MENTIONED, CALGARY ALL OF A

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:44.400
SUDDEN REELING. THEY LOOSE 7-3

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.667
TO THE OILERS ON SATURDAY AND

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.100
THEN GET SHUT OUT A GAME LATER.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:50.400
SO NOT MUCH GOING RIGHT FOR THEM

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.701
LATELY. WITH MUCH MORE ON

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.534
THIS ONE HERE IS GLENN SCHIILER

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:53.734
AND THE PANEL.

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:54.567
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.400
ALONGSIDE DAVE POULIN,

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:56.601
JEFF O'NEILL AND

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.067
BOB MACKENZIE. WELL, MUCH LIKE

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.300
HIS TEAM, WHAT A DIFFERENCE A

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:00.567
YEAR MAKES FOR NAZEM KADRI.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.033
REMEMBER THAT STRETCH LAST YEAR

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:03.467
AT THE BEGINNING, ONE GOAL IN

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.934
19 GAMES, JUST SNAKE PIT.

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.200
NOW JEFF, HE'S UP TO 20 GOALS,

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:07.033
HIS SHOTS FINDING THE BACK

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.934
OF THE NET.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.968
>> YEAH, GLENN, HE'S REALLY

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.868
BECOME A COMPLETE PLAYER FOR THE

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.701
TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS. HE'S DOING

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:12.868
IT AT ALL ENDS OF THE RINK, ALL

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:14.467
DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE HOCKEY

00:01:12.868 --> 00:01:16.067
GAME. AND TONIGHT I-- AS SOON AS

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.234
I GAVE HIM PROPS FOR SCORING IN

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:20.467
TIGHT AND NOT SHOOTING FROM

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:21.467
OUTSIDE THE DOTS, HE SCORES TWO

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:22.767
WRIST SHOT GOALS. WHAT A SEASON

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:23.767
TO HAVE 20 IN THE BANK RIGHT

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:24.767
NOW. WITH A LOT OF HOCKEY

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:26.067
GAMES LEFT, YOU KNOW THE REST

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:27.601
IS JUST GRAVY, GLENN. THERE'S NO

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:29.133
REASON WHY CAN'T GET 30, 35

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.200
GOALS THIS YEAR FOR THE LEAFS.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.300
>> MEANWHILE, YOU DON'T OFTEN

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.801
SEE JOHNNY HOCKEY GET CAUGHT

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.300
WITH A BODY CHECK, BUT HE TOOK

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:36.267
A LICKING A COUPLE OF TIMES THIS

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.901
GAME. THE BIG ONE OF COURSE, LEO

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:39.300
KOMAROV RUNNING HIM OVER. THE

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.300
FLAMES WANTED A HEADSHOT. BOB,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.167
HOW DO YOU THINK

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.167
THE LEAGUE WILL REVIEW THIS?

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.501
>> WELL, MY ESTEEMED PANEL

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.801
COLLEAGUE HERE, JEFF O'NEILL,

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:45.400
SAID RIGHT AWAY AS SOON AS IT

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:46.968
HAPPENED, THAT WAS A CLEAN

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.234
BUT VIOLENT HIT,

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:49.667
AND I'D BE VERY SURPRISED

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:51.133
IF THE LEAGUE SAW IT ANY OTHER

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.801
WAY THAN THAT. IT WAS NOT LATE,

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:54.667
IT WAS NOT A CHARGE, IT WAS NOT

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:56.434
AN ELBOW, THERE WAS NO LAUNCHING

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.200
INVOLVED. NOW, WAS THERE CONTACT

00:01:56.434 --> 00:02:00.367
TO THE HEAD? ABSOLUTELY, THERE

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.667
WAS. BUT I BELIEVE THE LEAGUE

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:03.267
WOULD SAY THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.567
CONTACT TO THE HEAD. A TALLER

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:06.133
PLAYER ON A SMALLER PLAYER.

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:08.000
THERE WAS BODY ON BODY CONTACT.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:10.300
THE HEAD CONTACT WAS INCIDENTAL,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.567
AND WHILE IT WAS A VERY VIOLENT

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.868
HIT, AND IT LOOKED FOR A MOMENT

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.934
AS IF JOHNNY GAUDREAU MIGHT BE

00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:15.434
OUT OF THE HOCKEY GAME,

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.734
AND THE FACT THAT HE CAME BACK

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:17.601
WAS A REAL POSITIVE, I DON'T

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:19.133
BELIEVE THERE'LL BE ANY

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:20.234
SUPPLEMENTARY DISCIPLINE. AND AS

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.033
WE POINTED OUT DURING THE GAME,

00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:23.934
NO PENALTY CALL ON THE PLAY. SO

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:25.868
THE REFS APPEAR TO HAVE GOTTEN

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:27.467
IT RIGHT AND I SUSPECT THE

00:02:25.868 --> 00:02:28.467
LEAGUE WILL ENDORSE THAT CALL--

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:28.467
NON-CALL BY THE REFEREES.
