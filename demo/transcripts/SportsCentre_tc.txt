00:00:00:09	>> Kate: MITCH MARNER PICKED UP
00:00:01:19	AN ASSIST ON KADRI'S 20TH. HE IS
00:00:03:17	NOW THE LEAGUE LEADER AMONG
00:00:05:03	ROOKIES WITH 39 POINTS. MARNER
00:00:06:14	ALSO HAS A TEAM-HIGH 12
00:00:08:28	MULTI-POINT GAMES THIS SEASON.
00:00:10:22	TORONTO'S ROOKIES HAVE 175
00:00:12:17	POINTS SO FAR THIS YEAR,
00:00:14:25	THAT IS THE MOST IN THE
00:00:17:16	NHL. WELCOME TO SPORTSCENTRE,
00:00:19:11	EVERYONE. KATE ALONGSIDE
00:00:20:22	NATASHA. SO UNFORTUNATELY FOR
00:00:22:16	THE FLAMES, I MEAN, THEY LOOKED
00:00:24:00	LIKE THEY HAD A LITTLE MOMENTUM
00:00:25:06	AS OF LATE, AND NOW THEY JUST
00:00:26:12	LOOK LIKE THEY'RE REELING ONCE
00:00:27:12	AGAIN. ON THE FLIP SIDE, THOUGH,
00:00:29:18	TORONTO SNAPPING THEIR MINI
00:00:30:17	SLIDE, AND GOOD FOR THEM TO PICK
00:00:34:01	UP A MONSTER WIN AT HOME BECAUSE
00:00:35:08	WE KNOW THEY'RE GREAT ON THE
00:00:36:15	ROAD BUT THEY HAVE STRUGGLED AT
00:00:37:17	TIMES AT THE AIR CANADA CENTRE.
00:00:38:19	>> YEAH, THEY LOOKED REALLY GOOD
00:00:39:27	ON MONDAY. AND LIKE YOU
00:00:40:29	MENTIONED, CALGARY ALL OF A
00:00:42:02	SUDDEN REELING. THEY LOOSE 7-3
00:00:43:04	TO THE OILERS ON SATURDAY AND
00:00:44:12	THEN GET SHUT OUT A GAME LATER.
00:00:46:20	SO NOT MUCH GOING RIGHT FOR THEM
00:00:48:03	LATELY. WITH MUCH MORE ON
00:00:50:12	THIS ONE HERE IS GLENN SCHIILER
00:00:51:21	AND THE PANEL.
00:00:52:16	>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:00:53:22	ALONGSIDE DAVE POULIN,
00:00:54:17	JEFF O'NEILL AND
00:00:55:12	BOB MACKENZIE. WELL, MUCH LIKE
00:00:56:18	HIS TEAM, WHAT A DIFFERENCE A
00:00:58:02	YEAR MAKES FOR NAZEM KADRI.
00:00:59:09	REMEMBER THAT STRETCH LAST YEAR
00:01:00:17	AT THE BEGINNING, ONE GOAL IN
00:01:02:01	19 GAMES, JUST SNAKE PIT.
00:01:03:14	NOW JEFF, HE'S UP TO 20 GOALS,
00:01:04:28	HIS SHOTS FINDING THE BACK
00:01:06:06	OF THE NET.
00:01:07:01	>> YEAH, GLENN, HE'S REALLY
00:01:07:28	BECOME A COMPLETE PLAYER FOR THE
00:01:08:29	TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS. HE'S DOING
00:01:09:26	IT AT ALL ENDS OF THE RINK, ALL
00:01:11:21	DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE HOCKEY
00:01:12:26	GAME. AND TONIGHT I-- AS SOON AS
00:01:14:14	I GAVE HIM PROPS FOR SCORING IN
00:01:16:02	TIGHT AND NOT SHOOTING FROM
00:01:17:07	OUTSIDE THE DOTS, HE SCORES TWO
00:01:20:14	WRIST SHOT GOALS. WHAT A SEASON
00:01:21:14	TO HAVE 20 IN THE BANK RIGHT
00:01:22:23	NOW. WITH A LOT OF HOCKEY
00:01:23:23	GAMES LEFT, YOU KNOW THE REST
00:01:24:23	IS JUST GRAVY, GLENN. THERE'S NO
00:01:26:02	REASON WHY CAN'T GET 30, 35
00:01:27:18	GOALS THIS YEAR FOR THE LEAFS.
00:01:29:04	>> MEANWHILE, YOU DON'T OFTEN
00:01:30:06	SEE JOHNNY HOCKEY GET CAUGHT
00:01:31:09	WITH A BODY CHECK, BUT HE TOOK
00:01:32:24	A LICKING A COUPLE OF TIMES THIS
00:01:34:09	GAME. THE BIG ONE OF COURSE, LEO
00:01:36:08	KOMAROV RUNNING HIM OVER. THE
00:01:37:27	FLAMES WANTED A HEADSHOT. BOB,
00:01:39:09	HOW DO YOU THINK
00:01:40:09	THE LEAGUE WILL REVIEW THIS?
00:01:41:05	>> WELL, MY ESTEEMED PANEL
00:01:41:05	COLLEAGUE HERE, JEFF O'NEILL,
00:01:42:15	SAID RIGHT AWAY AS SOON AS IT
00:01:43:24	HAPPENED, THAT WAS A CLEAN
00:01:45:12	BUT VIOLENT HIT,
00:01:46:29	AND I'D BE VERY SURPRISED
00:01:48:07	IF THE LEAGUE SAW IT ANY OTHER
00:01:49:20	WAY THAN THAT. IT WAS NOT LATE,
00:01:51:04	IT WAS NOT A CHARGE, IT WAS NOT
00:01:52:24	AN ELBOW, THERE WAS NO LAUNCHING
00:01:54:20	INVOLVED. NOW, WAS THERE CONTACT
00:01:56:13	TO THE HEAD? ABSOLUTELY, THERE
00:01:58:06	WAS. BUT I BELIEVE THE LEAGUE
00:02:00:11	WOULD SAY THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE
00:02:01:20	CONTACT TO THE HEAD. A TALLER
00:02:03:08	PLAYER ON A SMALLER PLAYER.
00:02:04:17	THERE WAS BODY ON BODY CONTACT.
00:02:06:04	THE HEAD CONTACT WAS INCIDENTAL,
00:02:08:00	AND WHILE IT WAS A VERY VIOLENT
00:02:10:09	HIT, AND IT LOOKED FOR A MOMENT
00:02:11:17	AS IF JOHNNY GAUDREAU MIGHT BE
00:02:12:26	OUT OF THE HOCKEY GAME,
00:02:13:28	AND THE FACT THAT HE CAME BACK
00:02:15:13	WAS A REAL POSITIVE, I DON'T
00:02:16:22	BELIEVE THERE'LL BE ANY
00:02:17:18	SUPPLEMENTARY DISCIPLINE. AND AS
00:02:19:04	WE POINTED OUT DURING THE GAME,
00:02:20:07	NO PENALTY CALL ON THE PLAY. SO
00:02:22:01	THE REFS APPEAR TO HAVE GOTTEN
00:02:23:28	IT RIGHT AND I SUSPECT THE
00:02:25:26	LEAGUE WILL ENDORSE THAT CALL--
00:02:27:14	NON-CALL BY THE REFEREES.
