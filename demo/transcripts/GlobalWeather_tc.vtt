WEBVTT

00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:03.467
It's all right you guys.

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.634
It's 4 degrees at the airport

00:00:03.467 --> 00:00:05.634
right now and we're seeing

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:06.801
mainly cloudy skies.

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:07.801
We saw some nice breaks of

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.801
sunshine this morning but

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.434
generally through the day,

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:12.033
cloudy skies and the sun was

00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:13.133
able to filtre its way through,

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.734
so that was nice.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.367
It was a fairly pleasant day

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.367
warming up to 7 degrees which

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:18.534
is our average.

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:19.901
That's right where we should be

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:21.901
sort of for this time of year.

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:23.300
Now when we look at the pattern

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.734
we still have that high pressure

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.167
in place, mild conditions across

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:27.300
our area, and it's fairly

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:28.534
stagnant across the south.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.734
Meanwhile, the North Coast

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:30.968
getting hammered by two

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:32.200
different systems, one really

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:34.067
affecting their region tonight.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.300
There's a wind warning in place.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.300
Southeast winds up to 90 kilometers

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.834
an hour expected.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.734
I'm already seeing reports at

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:41.734
about 66-70 kilometers an hour in

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.467
Prince Rupert.

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:45.200
But the jet stream is driving

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:46.934
way up into northern regions and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.367
we're going to see that pattern

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:50.100
continue into our Saturday and

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.534
that's really going to bring in

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.701
the milder air across northern

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:54.834
parts of the province.

00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:56.534
Some areas will be 20 degrees

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:57.534
above average in the coming

00:00:56.534 --> 00:00:58.701
days.

00:00:57.534 --> 00:00:59.701
Here's a look at the RE/MAX

00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.267
satellite.

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.767
We have some cloud cover

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:04.000
Just off the coast, though,

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.000
few showers starting to

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.534
push in.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.067
So tonight, for the lower

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:09.067
mainland South Coast, a slight

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.601
chance of showers.

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:11.801
We'll see that early tomorrow

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.667
morning but generally tomorrow

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.200
back to mainly cloudy skies as

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.434
these systems really just funnel

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.167
towards the North Coast.

00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:19.634
So wet and windy across the

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:21.367
North Coast, snow for inland

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:22.834
regions in the morning and by

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:24.868
the afternoon hours that spreads

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:26.300
all the way down into areas like

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:27.767
Prince George and over towards

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.234
Valemount, a real finger of

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:30.734
precipitation pushing in there.

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:32.968
Meanwhile, the South Coast

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:34.467
we'll see, be split in half.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.300
Northern regions from about

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:38.167
Sechelt north have the chance

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.667
of showers and then basically

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:41.167
Comox north across Vancouver

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.300
Island, the chance of

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.300
precipitation, dryer conditions

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.734
further south.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.968
And if you're in Whistler you do

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:46.968
have a chance of flurries as

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:47.968
well towards the afternoon

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:49.767
hours.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:51.234
So here's your forecast, as I

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:53.000
mentioned, wet and windy across

00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:54.000
the North Coast, even inland

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.167
regions.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.667
Smithers, though, I'm expecting

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:57.667
snow for you, it's colder,

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:58.934
about 5 centimeters.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.334
Flurries by the afternoon in

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.667
Prince George and down towards

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:02.667
Quesnel, and then over to

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:03.701
Valemount.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.701
Meanwhile, areas further south,

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:06.367
mainly cloudy.

00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:08.067
Same plan that you've seen in

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.434
the last couple of days and

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:10.767
you'll see that not only

00:02:09.434 --> 00:02:11.767
tomorrow but on Saturday as

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:13.567
well.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:15.367
South Coast as well, this is

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.367
your plan for tomorrow, the rain

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.868
across northern regions,

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:19.334
mostly dry across the south.

00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:20.334
Slight chance of showers but

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:21.868
that's about it.

00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:23.400
And we're hoping for a sunny

00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:24.701
breaks not only on Friday but

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400
into our Saturday as well.

00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:28.167
We don't see a change until

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.167
Sunday and it's a brief period

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:31.300
of rain.

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:32.601
And otherwise, we're back to

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.734
sunshine on Monday.

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:36.033
Happy birthday to Ida Kowalsky.

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:37.734
She turned 101.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:39.300
Winn Blake turned 100.

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:40.567
Congratulations to you both and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.834
a happy anniversary to

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:43.133
Anne and Al Hersh,

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:44.133
they celebrate their 70th

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:45.133
tonight.

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:46.534
Congratulations.

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:48.267
And our weather window for

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:49.367
tonight is a really neat shot

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:51.767
from the Northwest Territories

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:54.167
from John, which is a sundog

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:56.234
and I will put an explanation

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:57.234
of how that is made on our

00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:57.234
Facebook page.
