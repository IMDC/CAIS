00:01:01:00	00:01:02:23	00:00:01:23	information about the show is
00:01:02:23	00:01:04:15	00:00:01:22	released. Big question that a
00:01:04:15	00:01:06:19	00:00:02:04	lot of people are pondering this
00:01:06:19	00:01:08:01	00:00:01:12	weekend is, well, should
00:01:08:01	00:01:09:24	00:00:01:23	real-live animals appear in film
00:01:09:24	00:01:11:06	00:00:01:12	and television or is
00:01:11:06	00:01:12:08	00:00:01:02	computer-generated imagery, or
00:01:12:08	00:01:13:20	00:00:01:12	CGI, the better option?
00:01:13:20	00:01:14:22	00:00:01:02	According to TMZ animal rights
00:01:14:22	00:01:16:04	00:00:01:12	activists-- animal rights
00:01:16:04	00:01:17:29	00:00:01:25	activists, that is, will
00:01:17:29	00:01:19:02	00:00:01:03	be picketing movie theatres
00:01:19:02	00:01:21:07	00:00:02:05	over the film A Dog's Purpose.
00:01:21:07	00:01:22:27	00:00:01:20	Recently a video surfaced of
00:01:22:27	00:01:24:12	00:00:01:15	what appears to be a frightened
00:01:24:12	00:01:25:15	00:00:01:03	German shepherd being forced
00:01:25:15	00:01:27:07	00:00:01:22	into a pool of rushing water
00:01:27:07	00:01:28:11	00:00:01:04	during the filming of the
00:01:28:11	00:01:29:06	00:00:00:25	movie.
00:01:29:06	00:01:31:08	00:00:02:02	[Audience booing]
00:01:31:08	00:01:32:21	00:00:01:13	So, the production company
00:01:32:21	00:01:34:03	00:00:01:12	told TMZ that they did not force
00:01:34:03	00:01:35:20	00:00:01:17	the dog to go through with the
00:01:35:20	00:01:37:03	00:00:01:13	stunt. Instead they called a
00:01:37:03	00:01:38:22	00:00:01:19	break, and filmed it once the
00:01:38:22	00:01:40:09	00:00:01:17	dog calmed down and was okay
00:01:40:09	00:01:42:03	00:00:01:24	with it. So this is a big
00:01:42:03	00:01:43:23	00:00:01:20	controversy because it's
00:01:43:23	00:01:45:03	00:00:01:10	affecting the film now. As the
00:01:45:03	00:01:46:24	00:00:01:21	actress on the panel, what's
00:01:46:24	00:01:47:24	00:00:01:00	your take on this?
00:01:47:24	00:01:49:23	00:00:01:29	>> It's interesting the CGI
00:01:49:23	00:01:51:16	00:00:01:23	option, because I shot a film
00:01:51:16	00:01:52:28	00:00:01:12	last summer and we had to-- we
00:01:52:28	00:01:54:10	00:00:01:12	had a scene with a bear. It was
00:01:54:10	00:01:55:14	00:00:01:04	supposed to scare us and the
00:01:55:14	00:01:56:24	00:00:01:10	director met with various
00:01:56:24	00:01:58:06	00:00:01:12	trainers, and in the end he
00:01:58:06	00:02:00:27	00:00:02:19	didn't trust them quite
00:02:00:27	00:02:02:09	00:00:01:12	enough. So basically it was
00:02:02:09	00:02:03:27	00:00:01:18	CGIed. But I feel like sometimes
00:02:03:27	00:02:05:15	00:00:01:18	it is true that on set there is
00:02:05:15	00:02:07:00	00:00:01:15	that feeling of because we are
00:02:07:00	00:02:08:17	00:00:01:17	filming fiction we can push
00:02:08:17	00:02:11:15	00:00:02:28	the limits. And it's as if we
00:02:11:15	00:02:13:03	00:00:01:18	weren't shooting reality. And
00:02:13:03	00:02:14:22	00:00:01:19	me, as a child actor-- I mean,
00:02:14:22	00:02:15:29	00:00:01:07	we are talking about animals
00:02:15:29	00:02:17:09	00:00:01:10	right now but to me it's the
00:02:17:09	00:02:18:06	00:00:00:27	same thing with child actors.
00:02:18:06	00:02:19:20	00:00:01:14	I have seen and I have
00:02:19:20	00:02:21:12	00:00:01:22	experienced moments myself.
