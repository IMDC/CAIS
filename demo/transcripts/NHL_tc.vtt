00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:02.234
>> Third period about

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.067
to get underway here at the

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:06.868
MTS Centre in a 2-1 game for

00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:08.367
the Anaheim Ducks.

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:09.567
No scoring in period

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:10.434
number two.

00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:11.667
Andrew Copp finds a lane and

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.601
blows one by Jonathan Bernier.

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.701
Jets have the 1-0 lead.

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.133
Pavlec the save off of Fowler.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.601
Logan shot, bats in the rebound.

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.734
That was a shorthanded tally and

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:25.133
then Getzlaf leads the attack.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.000
It ends up on the stick of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.234
Rickard Rakell, who finds some

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:29.767
room on the short side.

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:31.200
And that's the way we stand

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.434
going into the third period.

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:35.133
>> And the third

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.234
period starts for the Winnipeg

00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:37.467
Jets with a power play.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.300
They had a little bit of a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.167
mix-up there at the end of

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.133
number two.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.634
Right now they have

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.000
Kesler's number on the board as

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.868
Kesler, Perry in the box for the

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:51.334
Ducks, and Mark Scheifele for

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:53.300
the Winnipeg Jets.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.267
>> Yeah, probably

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:55.434
Corey Perry's penalty because

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:57.100
they'll saw off Kesler and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.067
Scheifele, the original

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:01.601
combatants. and then, as you

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:02.968
mentioned, it was Corey

00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:04.033
Perry that came in and grabbed

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.934
Blake Wheeler.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.734
So the Jets do have the power

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.334
play, fourth power play of the

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:12.033
night for the Winnipeg Jets,

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.968
as they're down by one.

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:18.467
Fowler, and he'll dig it free,

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:19.601
clear it to the line.

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.234
Kept in, knocked down by Blake

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:23.234
Wheeler, for Dustin Byfuglien.

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:25.567
Into the slot. Brian Little,

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:27.100
a shot, and Cam Fowler got

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.133
in front of that.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.667
>> Ducks so good at

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:30.968
getting sticks in passing and

00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:33.467
shooting lanes.

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:34.734
>> Getzlaf couldn't

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.033
handle it. on it is Adam Lowry

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:37.968
for Blake Wheeler.

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:40.267
Wheeler put it to the front of

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.100
the net.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.901
No one could get a stick on it.

00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:44.834
After it is Nick Petan for

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.300
Adam Lowry, back for Petan.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.267
The Ducks very aggressive on

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:51.601
the penalty kill.

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:54.133
Wheeler back up top for

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.434
Byfuglien.

00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:56.601
The wrist shot, Bernier to

00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:59.501
save, rebound and cleared away.

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.133
Petan back for Byfuglien.

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.033
Byfuglien into the slot looking

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:03.200
for Little.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.834
Getzlaf knocked it away.

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:06.634
Petan sends it down low.

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:08.501
Bieksa with Little after him.

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:10.033
Lowry helps out.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.067
Lowry is up with it for Wheeler

00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:14.601
in front, trying to go backside.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.167
That got tipped away and it will

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:19.434
slip out to centre ice.

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.100
Petan very quickly back in for

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.934
Blake Wheeler.

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:23.634
Wheeler takes a bump, leaves it

00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:24.467
for Byfuglien.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:25.567
Around for Andrew Copp.

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:27.267
35 seconds in the power play,

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:28.267
Copp couldn't handle it.
