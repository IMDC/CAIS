00:00:00:14	It's all right you guys.
00:00:01:15	It's 4 degrees at the airport
00:00:03:14	right now and we're seeing
00:00:04:19	mainly cloudy skies.
00:00:05:19	We saw some nice breaks of
00:00:06:24	sunshine this morning but
00:00:07:24	generally through the day,
00:00:08:24	cloudy skies and the sun was
00:00:10:13	able to filtre its way through,
00:00:12:01	so that was nice.
00:00:13:04	It was a fairly pleasant day
00:00:14:22	warming up to 7 degrees which
00:00:16:11	is our average.
00:00:17:11	That's right where we should be
00:00:18:16	sort of for this time of year.
00:00:19:27	Now when we look at the pattern
00:00:21:27	we still have that high pressure
00:00:23:09	in place, mild conditions across
00:00:24:22	our area, and it's fairly
00:00:26:05	stagnant across the south.
00:00:27:09	Meanwhile, the North Coast
00:00:28:16	getting hammered by two
00:00:29:22	different systems, one really
00:00:30:29	affecting their region tonight.
00:00:32:06	There's a wind warning in place.
00:00:34:02	Southeast winds up to 90 kilometers
00:00:36:09	an hour expected.
00:00:37:09	I'm already seeing reports at
00:00:38:25	about 66-70 kilometers an hour in
00:00:40:22	Prince Rupert.
00:00:41:22	But the jet stream is driving
00:00:43:14	way up into northern regions and
00:00:45:06	we're going to see that pattern
00:00:46:28	continue into our Saturday and
00:00:48:11	that's really going to bring in
00:00:50:03	the milder air across northern
00:00:51:16	parts of the province.
00:00:52:21	Some areas will be 20 degrees
00:00:54:25	above average in the coming
00:00:56:16	days.
00:00:57:16	Here's a look at the RE/MAX
00:00:58:21	satellite.
00:00:59:21	We have some cloud cover
00:01:01:08	Just off the coast, though,
00:01:02:23	few showers starting to
00:01:04:00	push in.
00:01:05:00	So tonight, for the lower
00:01:06:16	mainland South Coast, a slight
00:01:08:02	chance of showers.
00:01:09:02	We'll see that early tomorrow
00:01:10:18	morning but generally tomorrow
00:01:11:24	back to mainly cloudy skies as
00:01:13:20	these systems really just funnel
00:01:15:06	towards the North Coast.
00:01:16:13	So wet and windy across the
00:01:18:05	North Coast, snow for inland
00:01:19:19	regions in the morning and by
00:01:21:11	the afternoon hours that spreads
00:01:22:25	all the way down into areas like
00:01:24:26	Prince George and over towards
00:01:26:09	Valemount, a real finger of
00:01:27:23	precipitation pushing in there.
00:01:29:07	Meanwhile, the South Coast
00:01:30:22	we'll see, be split in half.
00:01:32:29	Northern regions from about
00:01:34:14	Sechelt north have the chance
00:01:36:09	of showers and then basically
00:01:38:05	Comox north across Vancouver
00:01:39:20	Island, the chance of
00:01:41:05	precipitation, dryer conditions
00:01:42:09	further south.
00:01:43:09	And if you're in Whistler you do
00:01:44:22	have a chance of flurries as
00:01:45:29	well towards the afternoon
00:01:46:29	hours.
00:01:47:29	So here's your forecast, as I
00:01:49:23	mentioned, wet and windy across
00:01:51:07	the North Coast, even inland
00:01:53:00	regions.
00:01:54:00	Smithers, though, I'm expecting
00:01:55:05	snow for you, it's colder,
00:01:56:20	about 5 centimeters.
00:01:57:20	Flurries by the afternoon in
00:01:58:28	Prince George and down towards
00:02:00:10	Quesnel, and then over to
00:02:01:20	Valemount.
00:02:02:20	Meanwhile, areas further south,
00:02:03:21	mainly cloudy.
00:02:04:21	Same plan that you've seen in
00:02:06:11	the last couple of days and
00:02:08:02	you'll see that not only
00:02:09:13	tomorrow but on Saturday as
00:02:10:23	well.
00:02:11:23	South Coast as well, this is
00:02:13:17	your plan for tomorrow, the rain
00:02:15:11	across northern regions,
00:02:16:11	mostly dry across the south.
00:02:17:26	Slight chance of showers but
00:02:19:10	that's about it.
00:02:20:10	And we're hoping for a sunny
00:02:21:26	breaks not only on Friday but
00:02:23:12	into our Saturday as well.
00:02:24:21	We don't see a change until
00:02:26:12	Sunday and it's a brief period
00:02:28:05	of rain.
00:02:29:05	And otherwise, we're back to
00:02:31:09	sunshine on Monday.
00:02:32:18	Happy birthday to Ida Kowalsky.
00:02:34:22	She turned 101.
00:02:36:01	Winn Blake turned 100.
00:02:37:22	Congratulations to you both and
00:02:39:09	a happy anniversary to
00:02:40:17	Anne and Al Hersh,
00:02:41:25	they celebrate their 70th
00:02:43:04	tonight.
00:02:44:04	Congratulations.
00:02:45:04	And our weather window for
00:02:46:16	tonight is a really neat shot
00:02:48:08	from the Northwest Territories
00:02:49:11	from John, which is a sundog
00:02:51:23	and I will put an explanation
00:02:54:05	of how that is made on our
00:02:56:07	Facebook page.
