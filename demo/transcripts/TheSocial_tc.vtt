00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.400
scene, because it was just

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.334

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:49.567
[Audience cheers and applause]

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:51.267
Yes, Very exciting.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.234
And speaking of the Junos, the

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.634
2017 Juno Awards happen Sunday,

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:57.901
April 2nd. You can watch it

00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.167
right here on CTV and we will

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.000
keep you posted as more

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.767
information about the show is

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:04.501
released. Big question that a

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.634
lot of people are pondering this

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:08.033
weekend is, well, should

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.801
real-live animals appear in film

00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.200
and television or is

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.267
computer-generated imagery, or

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:13.667
CGI, the better option?

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:14.734
According to TMZ animal rights

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:16.133
activists-- animal rights

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.968
activists, that is, will

00:01:17.968 --> 00:01:19.067
be picketing movie theatres

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.234
over the film A Dog's Purpose.

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:22.901
Recently a video surfaced of

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:24.400
what appears to be a frightened

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.501
German shepherd being forced

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:27.234
into a pool of rushing water

00:01:27.234 --> 00:01:28.367
during the filming of the

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:29.200
movie.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.267
[Audience booing]

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:32.701
So, the production company

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:34.100
told TMZ that they did not force

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.667
the dog to go through with the

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:37.100
stunt. Instead they called a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.734
break, and filmed it once the

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.300
dog calmed down and was okay

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.100
with it. So this is a big

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.767
controversy because it's

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:45.100
affecting the film now. As the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.801
actress on the panel, what's

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:47.801
your take on this?

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:49.767
>> It's interesting the CGI

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:51.534
option, because I shot a film

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:52.934
last summer and we had to-- we

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:54.334
had a scene with a bear. It was

00:01:54.334 --> 00:01:55.467
supposed to scare us and the

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:56.801
director met with various

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.200
trainers, and in the end he

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.901
didn't trust them quite

00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:02.300
enough. So basically it was

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.901
CGIed. But I feel like sometimes

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.501
it is true that on set there is

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.000
that feeling of because we are

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.567
filming fiction we can push

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:11.501
the limits. And it's as if we

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.100
weren't shooting reality. And

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.734
me, as a child actor-- I mean,

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:15.968
we are talking about animals

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:17.300
right now but to me it's the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.200
same thing with child actors.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.667
I have seen and I have

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:21.400
experienced moments myself.
