00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:11.934
THE QUESTION EVERYONE IS

00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:13.467
PONDERING THIS WEEKEND, IS

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:15.300
SHOULD REAL LIVE ANIMALS

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.100
APPEAR IN FILM AND TELEVISION

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.734
OR IS COMPUTER-GENERATED

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.901
IMAGERY, OR CGI, THE BETTER

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:22.467
OPTION? ACCORDING TO TMZ,

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:24.501
ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WILL

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:26.667
BE PICKETING MOVIE THEATRES

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:28.100
OVER THE FILM A DOG'S PURPOSE.

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.200
RECENTLY A VIDEO SURFACED OF

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.834
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.367
FRIGHTENED GERMAN SHEPHERD

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:33.167
BEING FORCED INTO A POOL OF

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:33.767
RUSHING WATER DURING FILMING

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.968
OF THE MOVIE.

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:38.400
(BOOING)

00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:39.634
SO THE PRODUCTION COMPANY

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.234
TOLD TMZ THEY DID NOT FORCE

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:42.667
THE DOG TO GO THROUGH WITH THE

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.834
STUNT. AND INSTEAD CALLED A

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:45.601
BREAK AND FILMED IT WHEN THE

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:47.767
DOG CALMED DOWN AND WAS OK

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.567
WITH IT. SO THIS IS A BIG

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:51.534
CONTROVERSY BECAUSE IT IS

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:53.767
AFFECTING THE FILM NOW. AS AN

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:53.968
ACTRESS, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:55.200
IT?

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:56.467
>> INTERESTING WITH THE CGI

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.234
OPTION BECAUSE I SHOT A FILM

00:01:56.467 --> 00:02:00.300
LAST SUMMER AND WE HAD TO HAVE

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:02.033
A SCENE WITH A BEAR. AND IT WAS

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.868
SUPPOSED TO SCARE US AND THE

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.501
DIRECTOR MET WITH VARIOUS

00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:06.234
TRAINERS, AND IN THE END HE

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.634
DIDN'T TRUST THEM QUITE

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:10.400
ENOUGH. SO BASICALLY IT WAS

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.567
CGIED. I FEEL IT IS TRUE

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.734
SOMETIMES ON SET THAT THERE IS

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.734
A FEELING BECAUSE WE ARE

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:17.234
FILMING FICTION WE CAN PUSH

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:18.400
THE LIMITS. IT IS AS IF WE

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:19.400
WERE NOT SHOOTING REALITY. AND

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400
ME, AS A CHILD ACTOR, WE ARE.
