ARE GREAT ON THE ROAD BUT THEY

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.133
HAVE STRUGGLED AT TIMES AT THE

AIR CANADA CENTRE.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:49.033

MAKES FOR NAZEM KADRI.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.334
REMEMBER THE STRETCH LAST YEAR

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:08.868
AT THE BEGINNING, ONE GOAL IN

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:11.334
19 GAMES, JUST SNAKE PIT. BUT

NOW UP TO 20 GOALS, HIS SHOTS

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:13.367
FINDING THE NET.

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:14.868
>> HE HAS ONLY BECOME A

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:15.934
COMPLETE PLAYER FOR THE

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:17.434
TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS. DOING IT

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:19.267
AT ALL ENDS OF THE RINK,

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:21.100
DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE HOCKEY

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:22.100
GAME. TONIGHT I GAVE HIM PROPS

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.534
FOR SCORING INSIGHT ARE NOT

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.734
OUTSIDE THE DOTS BEFORE HIS

00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:30.834
GOALS. WHAT THE SEASON TO HAVE

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:32.200
20 IN THE BAG. WITH A LOT LEFT,

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:34.801
THE REST IS GREATLY. NO REASON

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
WHY CAN'T GET 30, 35 GOALS FOR

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:36.501
THE LEAFS.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.100
>> MEANWHILE, YOU DON'T OFTEN

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.501
SEE JOHNNY HOCKEY GET A BODY

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.200
CHECK BUT HE TOOK A LICKING A

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:42.334
COUPLE OF TIMES THIS GAME. THE

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.968
BIG GAME WITH LEO KOMAROV

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:46.467
RUNNING HIM OVER. THE FLAMES

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:47.434
WANTED A HEADSHOT. HOW WILL

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.667
THE LEAGUE REVIEW THIS?

00:01:47.434 --> 00:01:49.868
>> MY ESTEEMED PANEL COLLEAGUE

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:51.100
HERE JEFF O'NEILL SAID AS SOON

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:54.300
AS HAPPENED, THAT WAS A CLEAN

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.501
BUT VIOLENT HIT, AND I'D BE

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.701
SURPRISED IF THE LEAGUE SAW IT

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:59.400
ANY OTHER WAY THAN THAT. IT

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.801
WAS NOT A CHARGE, NOT AN

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.501
ELBOW, NO WATCHING INVOLVED.

00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:04.501
WAS THE CONTACT OF THE HEAD?

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.033
ABSOLUTELY, THERE WAS. BUT I

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.100
BELIEVE THE LEAGUE WOULD SAY

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.300
THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE CONTACT TO

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.501
THE HEAD. A SMALLER PLAYER ON

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.234
IT ALL A PLAYER. THERE WAS

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.033
BODY ON BODY CONTACT. THE HEAD

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:15.767
CONTACT WAS INCIDENTAL, AND

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.133
WHILE IT WAS A VERY VIOLENT

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:19.834
HIT AND LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AS

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:21.100
IF JOHNNY GAUDREAU MIGHT NOT

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:22.801
COME BACK, THE FACT HE CAME

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.834
BACK WAS A POSITIVE AND I DO

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:24.567
NOT BELIEVE THERE WILL BE

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:26.601
SUPPLEMENTAL DISCIPLINE. AND AS

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:27.601
WE POINTED OUT IN THE GAME, NO

00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:27.601
PENALTY CALL ON THE PLATE SO.
