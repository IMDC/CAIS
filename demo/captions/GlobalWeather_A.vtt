00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.300

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.300
WE SAW SOME NICE BREAKS OF

SUNSHINE THIS MORNING BUT

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.734
GENERALLY THROUGH THE DAY, CLOUDY

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.334
SKIES AND THE SUN WAS ABLE TO

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.501
FILTRE ITS WAY THROUGH SO THAT

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:18.234
WAS NICE. IT WAS A FAIRLY

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:19.634
PLEASANT DAY WARMING UP TO 7 DEGREES

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:20.634

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:21.634
RIGHTS WHERE WE SHOULD BE SORT

00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:22.834
OF FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. WHEN

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:24.634
WE LOOK AT THE PATTERN WE STILL

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:25.634
HAVE THAT HIGH PRESSURE IN

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:27.701
PLACE, MILD CONDITIONS ACROSS

00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:29.100

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.100
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS, ONE REALLY

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.534
