WEBVTT

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 >> Kate: MITCH MARNER PICKED UP

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 AN ASSIST ON KADRI'S 20th.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 HE'S NOW THE LEAGUE LEADER AMONG

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 ROOKIES WITH 39 POINTS.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 MARNER ALSO HAS A TEAM HIGH 12

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 MULTI-APPOINTMENT GAMES THIS

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 SEASON.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 TORONTO'S ROOKIES HAVE 175

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 POINTS SO FAR THIS YEAR,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 THAT IS THE MOST IN THE NHL.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 >>> WELCOME TO "SPORTSCENTRE"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 EVERYONE.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 KATE ALONGSIDE NATASHA.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 SO UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE FLAMES,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 I MEAN, THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 HAD A LITTLE BIT OF MOMENTUM AT

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 OF LATE AND NOW THEY LOOK LIKE

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 THEY ARE REELING ONCE AGAIN.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 ON THE FLIP SIDE THOUGH TORONTO

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 SNAPPING THEIR MINI SLIDE,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 AND GOOD FOR THEM TO PICK UP A

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 MONSTER WIN AT HOME,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 WE KNOW THEY ARE GREAT ON THE

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 ROAD BUT THEY HAVE STRUGGLED AT

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 TIMES AT THE AIR CANADA CENTRE.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 >> Natasha: THEY LOOKED REALLY

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 GOOD ON MONDAY. AND CALGARY ALL

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 OF A SUDDEN REELING.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 LOSE 7-3 TO THE OILERS SATURDAY

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 AND SHUTOUT A GAME LATER.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 NOT MUCH GOING RIGHT FOR THEM.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 WITH MORE HERE IS GLENN SCHIILER

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 AND THE PANEL. .

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 >> Glenn: ALONGSIDE DAVE POULIN,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 JEFF O'NEILL AND BOB McKENZIE.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 MUCH LIKE HIS TEAM WHAT A

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES FOR

00:01:03.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 NAZEM KADRI.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 REMEMBER THAT STRETCH LAST YEAR

00:00:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 AT THE BEGINNING,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 ONE GOAL IN 19 GAMES,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 JUST SNAKE BIT.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 NOW JEFF HE'S UP TO 20 GOALS HIS

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 SHOT FINDING THE BACK OF THE

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 NET.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 >> HE'S BECOME A COMPLETE PLAYER

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 FOR THE TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 DOING IT ALL PHASES OF THE

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 HOCKEY GAME.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 TONIGHT I GIVE HIM PROPS FOR

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 SHOOTING NOT INSIDE THE DOT HE

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 SCORES TWO.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 WHAT A SEASON TO HAVE 20 IN THE

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 BANK WITH A LOT OF HOCKEY GAMES

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 LEFT.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 THERE'S NO REASON WHY HE CAN'T

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 GET 30, 35 GOALS FOR THE LEAFS.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 >> Glenn: YOU DON'T SEE JOHNNY

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 HOCKEY GET CAUGHT WITH A

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 BODYCHECK BUT HE TOOK A LICKIN A

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 COUPLE OF TIMES.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 LEO KOMAROV RUNNING HIM OVER.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 THE FLAMES WANTED A HEADSHOT.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 HOW DO YOU THINK THE LEAGUE WILL

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 REVIEW THIS.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 >> JEFF O'NEILL SAID AS SOON AS

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 IT HAPPENED THAT WAS A CLEAN BUT

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 VIOLENT HIT, 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 AND I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 LEAGUE SAW IT ANY OTHER WAY.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 IT WAS NOT LATE,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 IT WAS NOT A CHARGE,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 IT WAS NOT AN ELBOW,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 NO LAUNCHING INVOLVED.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 WAS THERE CONTACT TO THE HEAD.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 ABSOLUTELY.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 BUT I BELIEVE THE LEAGUE WOULD

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 SAY THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE CONTACT

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 TO THE HEAD.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 A SMALLER PLAYER, AND A SMALLER

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 PLAYER. THERE WAS BODY ON BODY

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 CONTACT.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 WHILE IT WAS A VERY VIOLENT HIT

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 AND LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AS IF

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 JOHNNY GAUDREAU MIGHT BE OUT OF

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 THE HOCKEY GAME AND THE FACT HE

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 CAME BACK WAS A POSITIVE,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WOULD BE

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 ANY SUPPLEMENTALLY DISCIPLINE.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 AS WE POINTED OUT DURING THE

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 GAME NO PENALTY CALL ON THE

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 PLAY.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 THE REFS APPEAR TO HAVE GOTTEN

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 IT RIGHT AND I SUSPECT THE

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 LEAGUE WILL
