00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 RELEASED.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 BIG QUESTION THAT A LOT OF

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 PEOPLE ARE PONDERING, SHOULD

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 REAL LIVE ANIMALS APPEAR IN FILM

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 OR TELEVISION OR IS COMPUTER

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 GENERATED IMAGERY THE BETTER

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 OPTION?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 ACCORDING TO TMZ ANIMAL RIGHTS

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 ACTIVIST ALSO BE PICKETING MOVIE

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 THEATERS OVER THE FILM "A DOG'S

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 PURPOSE".

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 RECENTLY, A VIDEO SURFACED OF

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FRIGHTENED

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 GERMAN SHEPHERD BEING FORCED

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 INTO A POOL OF RUSHING WATER

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 DURING THE FILMING OF THE MOVIE.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 [ Booing ]

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 SO THE PRODUCTION COMPANY TOLD

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 TMZ THEY DID NOT FORCE THE DOG

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 TO GO THROUGH WITH THE STUNT.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 INSTEAD THEY CALLED A BREAK AND

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 FILMED IT ONCE THE DOG CALMED

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 DOWN AND WAS OKAY WITH IT.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 SO THIS IS A BIG CONTROVERSY

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 BECAUSE IT'S AFFECTING THE FILM

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 NOW. AS THE ACTRESS ON THE PANEL

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THIS?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 >> IT'S INTERESTING, THE CGI

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 OPTION,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 I SHOT A FILM LAST SUMMER AND WE

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 HAD A SCENE WITH A BEAR.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SCARE US,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 THE DIRECTOR MET WITH VARIOUS

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 TRAINERS,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 IN THE END, HE DIDN'T TRUST THEM

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 QUITE ENOUGH.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 SO BASICALLY IT WAS CGI.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES IT'S TRUE

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 ONSET THERE'S A FEELING OF

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 BECAUSE WE'RE FILMING FICTION WE

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 CAN PUSH THE LIMITS.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 AND IT'S AS IF WE WEREN'T

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 SHOOTING REALITY. AND ME AS A

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 CHILD ACTOR, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 ANIMALS RIGHT NOW BUT TO ME IT'S

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 THE SAME THING WITH CHILD

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 ACTORS.
